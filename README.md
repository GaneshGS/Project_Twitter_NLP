### Project_Twitter_NLP
Building Event Extraction and Trending Framework for Twitter


This is my capstone project for the Data Science Immersive at General Assembly. 

In this project, my goals are:
  1. Set up real-time Data Collection process and Data Infrastructure
  2. Examine different Natural Language Processing tools on collected tweets
  3. Create A|B Testing Model on similarity comparison
  4. Use Time Series Modeling to catch the trends
  5. Tuning hyperparameters for model improvement

To test my framework:
  1. I collected and cleaned over 1.5 million tweets from uing TwitterStream API
  2. Create scheduled and on demand LSA processing for text vectrozation
  3. Event and Trend Detection using Cosine Similarity and ARIMA modeling

#### Technologies used in the project
